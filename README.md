# NestFundamental

This repository is a sample application to learn about Nest.js, with a focus on how Guards, Interceptors, and Exception Filters work together.

The application currently has a single route for artists, but other routes can be added. It also includes JWT authentication and role-based authentication, with only admins able to perform CRUD operations.
